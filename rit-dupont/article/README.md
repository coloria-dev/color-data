  #### Abstract

  A color-difference dataset was developed for testing the performance of color metrics.
  The dataset comprises 45 color-difference vectors varying in five directions at nine
  color centers under conditions typical of commercial color decisions. Probit analysis
  was used to estimate the parameters of the population distribution of tolerances for
  each vector. In addition to estimating the median tolerance, the anlysis allows one to
  estimate the uncertainty of a tolerance and to test the adequacy of the underlying
  model tolerance distribution. The median tolerances were used to specify 45
  color-difference pairs with equal visual color-difference magnitudes. The performance
  of eight color-difference metrics was compared using the normalized standard deviation
  of the color differences of the visually equal difference pairs as a measure of
  uniformity. A bootstrap statistical technique was used to quantify the variation in
  performance with varying samples of color centers and color-difference directions and
  to determine the significance of observed differences in uniformity performance. Some
  metrics based on weighted CIELAB dl\*, dC\*, dH\* color-difference components had
  significantly superior performance compared to the CIE recommended color-difference
  metrics.

  #### Abstract

  A generalized color-difference space was introduced based on theories of multi-stage
  color vision, for example, the zone theory, and extended by integrating line elements.
  This space had the following features: chromatic adaptation, a linear transformation
  from CIE tristimulus values to cone fundamentals, a nonlinear compression stage, a
  second linear transformation to opponent signals, and line-element integration that
  was a function of chroma. Variants of this generalized color-difference space were
  derived using the RIT-DuPont and Qiao et al. datasets of equal perceived color
  differences. These spaces had improved performance compared with CIELAB and resulted
  in a Euclidean distance metric with statistically equivalent or superior performance
  to the current CIE recommended color-difference formula, CIEDE2000.
