The CIE Technical Report Colorimetry (from where the above data are) says:

> Section 11 provides abridged tables that can be used in many practical calculations.
> On the use of these tables see Section 7.2. The values of relative spectral power
> distribution of CIE standard illuminant 065 given in Table T.1 at 5 nm intervals are
> consistent with the values from 300 nm to 830 nm at 1 nm intervals and with six
> significant figures given in CIE standard illuminants for colorimetry (CIE, 1998c).
> They have been taken from the tables of the Standard.

one can find 1nm data that is consistent with the data in the above XLS files and also
matches 1nm the checksums. Hence, assume that this is the actual standard data; use it
here.
