# Optimal Colour Stimuli

## Abstract

Tristimulus values have been computed for hypothetical spectrophotometric
curves of the type found to give the maximum visual reflectance factor
(or transmission factor) for specified chromaticities. These computations have
been based on the I.C.I. 1931 data for the normal observer for colorimetry,
and on the I.C.I. Illuminants "A" and "C".

By plotting the results on the I.C.I. color mixture diagram, the loci of
points characterized by equal maximum efficiencies have been established.
Tables have been prepared showing the maximum visual efficiency as a function
of excitation purity for twenty-four dominant wave-lengths.
