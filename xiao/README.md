### Abstract

Psychophysical experiments were conducted to assess unique hues on a CRT
display for a large sample of colour-normal observers (n = 185). These data
were then used to evaluate the most commonly used colour appearance model,
CIECAM02, by transforming the CIEXYZ tristimulus values of the unique hues to
the CIECAM02 colour appearance attributes, lightness, chroma and hue angle. We
report two findings: (1) the hue angles derived from our unique hue data are
inconsistent with the commonly used Natural Color System hues that are
incorporated in the CIECAM02 model. We argue that our predicted unique hue
angles (derived from our large dataset) provide a more reliable standard for
colour management applications when the precise specification of these salient
colours is important. (2) We test hue uniformity for CIECAM02 in all four
unique hues and show significant disagreements for all hues, except for unique
red which seems to be invariant under lightness changes. Our dataset is useful
to improve the CIECAM02 model as it provides reliable data for benchmarking.
